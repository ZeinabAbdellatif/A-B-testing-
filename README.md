# A-B-testing-
A/B tests are very commonly performed tests by data analysts. 
For this project, the A/B test will be performed to evaluate whether an e-commerce website should launch a new webpage, keep their old page or prolong the experiment's duration.
After importing the required libraries from Pandas, I performed some data cleaning (i.e. removing duplicates). Now, we have 2 groups; experimental one using the new webpage and the control group using the old one. The number of participants in each group was seen to ensure equal numbers in each group. The rate of conversion in each group was calculated.
